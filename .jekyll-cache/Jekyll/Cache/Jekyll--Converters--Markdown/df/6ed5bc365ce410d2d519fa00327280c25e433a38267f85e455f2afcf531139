I"‡<h2> Rostow's 5 Stage of Development: </h2>

<p><b>Traditional Society: </b></p>

<p>Â mostly subsistence farming, little of which is traded. Low productivity and little-to-no surplus to sell in wider markets.eg, remote village or war torn country.</p>

<p><b> Preconditions for Take-Off: </b></p>

<p>more mechanised agriculture with some trade. Savings and investment grow, though still a small percentage of national income (GDP).Low wages, intense labour .Some external funding is required (overseas aid or remittance incomes from migrant workers living overseas)</p>

<p><b> Take-Off: (short period of intense growth) </b></p>

<p>Usually.Manufacturing industry assumes greater importance, although the number of industries remains small. Political and social institutions start to develop - external finance still is required. Savings and investment grow, perhaps to 15% of GDP. Agriculture assumes lesser importance in relative terms although the majority of people may remain employed in the farming sector. Inequality starts to develop.</p>

<p><b> Drive to Maturity: (Long period of time) </b></p>

<p>Industry becomes more diverse. Growth should spread to different parts of the country as the state of technology improves - the economy moves from being dependent on factor inputs for growth towards making better use of innovation to bring about increases in real per capita incomes.</p>

<p><b> Age of Mass Consumption: (Mass production and consumerism)Â </b></p>

<p>Output levels grow, enabling increased consumer expenditure. There is a shift towards tertiary (service based) sector activity and the growth is sustained by the expansion of a middle class of consumers.</p>

<h3> Types of Industries: </h3>

<p>Primary Industries: Produces raw materials.</p>

<p>Secondary Industries: Manufactures Product.</p>

<p>Tertiary Industries: Provides Services.</p>

<h3> Two views on 'Development' : </h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Material Wealth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Freedom / Representation / Happiness.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Why one view is better than the other.</p>

<p><b> Economic liberalism / Neo Liberalism vs protectionismÂ </b></p>

<p>Economic Liberalism:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Low State involvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High State involvement.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Eg, Gujarat vs Bangalore. Gujarat was open to all kinds of investors but Karnataka decided that they wanted to be an IT giant and stole a generation of IT jobs from the USA.</p>

<p><b> High State Involvement Pros: </b></p>

<p>Why the gov is the better economic driver for development rather than the market</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Controls Entire chain, builds more economic assets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gov produces raw material instead of buying it from the cheapest source. Growth is fueled by lots of people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Free market is discriminatory because it helps people who already have money. Gov involvement makes it equal for growing industries.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Eg, potential for authoritarianism, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan.</p>

<p><b> Development Obstacles: </b></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of Diversity: The economy is completely based on a single sector.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Backward Natural Resources: un-utilized, under-utilized or mis-utilized resources. Lack of technology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dutch Disease: increase in the economic development of a specific sector (for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resources">natural resources</a>) and a decline in other sectors (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_industry">manufacturing sector</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture">agriculture</a>). Nations currency becomes stronger, making other goods expensive for export.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conflict Over Ownership: geopolitical / political reasons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Political Obstacle: Political Instability, insincere leaders, changes in fiscal policy.Â </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bad Governance and weak institution: Corruption, Lengthy legal process, favouritism and nepotism.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social and Cultural Obstacles: Illiteracy, unproductive expenditure, rapidly rising population, waste of resources, Low participation of women, Brain-drain.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2> Aid: </h2>

<p>Types: Grant or Loan</p>

<p>Provided to Government or Directly to Community.</p>

<p>Conditional or unconditional</p>

<p>Why Developmental Aid is Bad for recipient country:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Death of local industries, local industries lose incentive to produce.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neocolonialism</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aid dependency</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Corruption.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4> Donor Countries Incentive to provide Development Aid: </h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Humanitarian Reason</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Diplomatic or political influence (Marshal plan for preventing the spread of communism in Europe after WWII)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strategic advantages. (China got to use the deep sea port in Srilanka for 99 years for a $1.5B loan grant and a deep sea port in Pakistan for 40 years; Naval Base in Djibouti, Somalia)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Own construction companies and workers get profited, because of contracts in recipient countries.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
