<h2> Rostow's 5 Stage of Development: </h2>

<b>Traditional Society: </b>

 mostly subsistence farming, little of which is traded. Low productivity and little-to-no surplus to sell in wider markets.eg, remote village or war torn country.

<b> Preconditions for Take-Off: </b>

more mechanised agriculture with some trade. Savings and investment grow, though still a small percentage of national income (GDP).Low wages, intense labour .Some external funding is required (overseas aid or remittance incomes from migrant workers living overseas)

<b> Take-Off: (short period of intense growth) </b>

Usually.Manufacturing industry assumes greater importance, although the number of industries remains small. Political and social institutions start to develop - external finance still is required. Savings and investment grow, perhaps to 15% of GDP. Agriculture assumes lesser importance in relative terms although the majority of people may remain employed in the farming sector. Inequality starts to develop.

<b> Drive to Maturity: (Long period of time) </b>

Industry becomes more diverse. Growth should spread to different parts of the country as the state of technology improves - the economy moves from being dependent on factor inputs for growth towards making better use of innovation to bring about increases in real per capita incomes.

<b> Age of Mass Consumption: (Mass production and consumerism) </b>

Output levels grow, enabling increased consumer expenditure. There is a shift towards tertiary (service based) sector activity and the growth is sustained by the expansion of a middle class of consumers.

 <h3> Types of Industries: </h3>

Primary Industries: Produces raw materials.

Secondary Industries: Manufactures Product.

Tertiary Industries: Provides Services.

<h3> Two views on 'Development' : </h3>

1.  Material Wealth.

2.  Freedom / Representation / Happiness.

Why one view is better than the other.

<b> Economic liberalism / Neo Liberalism vs protectionism </b>

Economic Liberalism:

1.  Low State involvement.

2.  High State involvement.

Eg, Gujarat vs Bangalore. Gujarat was open to all kinds of investors but Karnataka decided that they wanted to be an IT giant and stole a generation of IT jobs from the USA.

<b> High State Involvement Pros: </b>

Why the gov is the better economic driver for development rather than the market

1.  Controls Entire chain, builds more economic assets.

2.  The gov produces raw material instead of buying it from the cheapest source. Growth is fueled by lots of people.

3.  Free market is discriminatory because it helps people who already have money. Gov involvement makes it equal for growing industries.

Eg, potential for authoritarianism, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan.

<b> Development Obstacles: </b>

1.  Lack of Diversity: The economy is completely based on a single sector.

2.  Backward Natural Resources: un-utilized, under-utilized or mis-utilized resources. Lack of technology.

3.  Dutch Disease: increase in the economic development of a specific sector (for example [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resources)) and a decline in other sectors (like the [manufacturing sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_industry) or [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture)). Nations currency becomes stronger, making other goods expensive for export.

4.  Conflict Over Ownership: geopolitical / political reasons.

5.  Political Obstacle: Political Instability, insincere leaders, changes in fiscal policy. 

6.  Bad Governance and weak institution: Corruption, Lengthy legal process, favouritism and nepotism.

7.  Social and Cultural Obstacles: Illiteracy, unproductive expenditure, rapidly rising population, waste of resources, Low participation of women, Brain-drain.

<h2> Aid: </h2>

Types: Grant or Loan

Provided to Government or Directly to Community.

Conditional or unconditional

Why Developmental Aid is Bad for recipient country:

1.  Death of local industries, local industries lose incentive to produce.

2.  Neocolonialism

3.  Aid dependency

4.  Corruption.

<h4> Donor Countries Incentive to provide Development Aid: </h4>

1.  Humanitarian Reason

2.  Diplomatic or political influence (Marshal plan for preventing the spread of communism in Europe after WWII)

3.  Strategic advantages. (China got to use the deep sea port in Srilanka for 99 years for a $1.5B loan grant and a deep sea port in Pakistan for 40 years; Naval Base in Djibouti, Somalia)

4.  Own construction companies and workers get profited, because of contracts in recipient countries.
