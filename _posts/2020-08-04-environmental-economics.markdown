Pollution is a byproduct of human existence. But it is harmful for nature and human existence. So we must reduce pollution.

So, intuitively this is how we can reduce air pollution.

1.  Identify the sources of most air pollution.Factories that use fossil fuels; Industries that run on oil and coal; vehicles with internal combustion engines.

2.  Decrease the supply or decrease the demand of the sources.But No country owns the environment so there is no economic incentive to save the environment. On the other hand, traditional fuel has been a regular part in the industries where new alternatives are costly and inefficient so it is hard to replace the demand of traditional sources.

So Solutions:

1.  Regulate policy to countries so that they maintain proper environmental actions.

2.  Invest in research for finding alternative energy.

3.  Apply rules about how much a specific type of industry can pollute.

4.  Price incentive to consumers.(a) adding tax to gasoline and other things that pollute the air, (b) subsidizing electric cars that pollute the air less.

5.  The industry can increase fuel efficiency. But sometimes it doesn't work because of the rebounding effect.

<h4>Rebounding Effect:</h4>Â  According to behavioral economics since the cost has fallen, the user might increase the use of the product that is causing more pollution.

Secondly, efficiency might decrease the demand for fuel resulting in the price fall. As a result more people will buy cars and total pollution will be increased.

So, any kind of sudden change is bad for the environment.

Some believe that government intervention is bad for the market. But regarding protecting the environment gov intervention is not only important but also necessary.
